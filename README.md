### Introduction

write an R
function that is able to cache potentially time-consuming computations.
For example, taking the mean of a numeric vector is typically a fast
operation. However, for a very long vector, it may take too long to
compute the mean, especially if it has to be computed repeatedly (e.g.
in a loop). If the contents of a vector are not changing, it may make
sense to cache the value of the mean so that when we need it again, it
can be looked up in the cache rather than recomputed. In this
Programming Assignment you will take advantage of the scoping rules of
the R language and how they can be manipulated to preserve state inside
of an R object.

 Caching the Inverse of a Matrix

Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some
benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it
repeatedly (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will
not discuss here). Your assignment is to write a pair of functions that
cache the inverse of a matrix.

following functions:

1.  `makeCacheMatrix`: This function creates a special "matrix" object
    that can cache its inverse.
2.  `cacheSolve`: This function computes the inverse of the special
    "matrix" returned by `makeCacheMatrix` above. If the inverse has
    already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then
    `cacheSolve` should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the `solve`
function in R. For example, if `X` is a square invertible matrix, then
`solve(X)` returns its inverse.

assume that the matrix supplied is always invertible.
